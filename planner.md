# Planner

**How to maintain this file**
- Keep plan IDs sequential starting from `P1`; renumber the table when adding or removing rows so there are no gaps.
- Use this file for short- to medium-term planning that is not yet committed work; move actionable items to `todo.md` or `ignored.md` once scoped.
- Capture enough detail (owner, dependencies, next steps) to unblock implementation while keeping entries concise and security-aware.
- When a plan is completed or canceled, remove the row and, if work remains, add the appropriate entry to `todo.md` or `ignored.md` with a new ID.
- Prefer small, reviewable milestones that align with the guardrails in `AGENTS.md` and avoid broad refactors without coordination.
